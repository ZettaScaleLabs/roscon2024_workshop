## About

Welcome! This repository is part of the `Demystifying ROS 2 Networking` workshop, scheduled to take place on October 21st at ROSCon 2024. It contains all the resources you‚Äôll need to get started with `rmw_zenoh`, the Zenoh middleware for `ROS 2`.

In this hands-on workshop, you‚Äôll explore how to leverage Zenoh as a ROS 2 middleware (RMW) layer. Whether you're new to Zenoh or looking to deepen your understanding of it, this workshop is designed to give you practical insights through simple demonstrations.

What's Included:
* Dockerized environment: Pre-configured for easy setup and reproducibility.
* Simple ROS 2 applications: Designed to showcase the use of rmw_zenoh.
* Scripts and utilities: Simplifying container management and environment setup.

Get ready to dive into the exciting world of ROS 2 networking with Zenoh!

## Environment

All the workshop is using Docker containers, so you need a host running Docker. `amd64` or `arm64` architectures are both supported.

### Docker image installation

The simplest is to pull it from Docker hub:
```bash
docker pull zettascaletech/roscon2024_workshop
```

You can also build it yourself running the provided `build_image.sh` script:
```bash
./docker/build_image.sh
```
The image will be named `workshop_roscon2024` or with the `$IMAGE_NAME` environment variable if defined.

The image have ROS 2 Jazzy Jalisco (core) installed with the demo ROS 2 packages already available. It also has a workspace under `/ros_ws` with `rmw_zenoh` already built and installed from sources.

### Docker container usage

Some scripts are available under `docker` directory to help you with container management:
- Run `./docker/create_container.sh` to create a new container named `workshop_roscon2024` or with the `$CONTAINER_NAME` environment variable if defined.  
  Some important directories in this container:
  - `/ros_ws`: the ROS workspace
  - `/ros_ws/src/rmw_zenoh`: `rmw_zenoh` sources (it's already built and installed in the workspace)
  - `/ros_ws/zenoh_confs`: a volume corresponding to the `zenoh_confs/` directory in this reporitory

- Run `./docker/login_container.sh` to start a bash shell within the container
- Run `./docker/restart_container.sh` to restart the container
- Run `./docker/stop_container.sh` to stop the container
- Run `./docker/rm_container.sh` to delete the container
- Run `./docker/rm_image.sh` to delete the image

## Exercises

### 1. Zenoh router and ROS Nodes

The first role of the Zenoh router in ROS 2 is to act as a discovery service for the ROS Nodes running on the same host.  
Each Node automatically tries to connect to the local router at startup, waiting for it if connection fails. The router forwards the locators (IP+port) of each Nodes to other Nodes, so they automatically establish peer-to-peer connection with each other. Once interconnected, 2 Nodes no longer need the router to communicate with each other.

Within the same container, login with 3 different terminals to experiment with `demo_nodes_cpp`'s `talker` and `listener` running:
- `ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker`: the talker is waiting for the Zenoh router
- `ros2 run rmw_zenoh_cpp rmw_zenohd`: starts the router - the talker shall now publish
- `ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener`: the listener shall receive messages from the talker
- CTRL+C on zenoh router: the talker and listener shall continue to exchange messages
